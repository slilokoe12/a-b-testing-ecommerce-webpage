### 

For this project, I was working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to 
help the company understand if they should implement the new retail page , keep the old retail page, or perhaps run the 
experiment longer for them to make a definitive decision.

I performed a hypothesis test, H0: new_page is less than or equals to old_page H1: p_new is greater than p_old at a 
Type I error rate of 5% and the results showed that they would get more sales and customers from their existing old page. 

I also investigated the interaction of some other variable like the country of the client and the conversion rate of that citizen 
visiting their web page and converting/subsscribing to their productst to see if that was a contributiing factor.
